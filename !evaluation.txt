Good:
Following MVC
Postman collection file included
Routes in routes file
Correct HTTP verbs

Bad:
SonarQube analysis: 1 code smell for unnecessarily repeated code
POST and PUT data being sent in the queryString instead of in the body ***
2 attributes for the image instead of an object attribute, as requested in the assignment.
No types used, no TypeScript features used.
Code is not object oriented
No input validation
Incorrect HTTP Codes (503 for not found?)
Wrong naming convention for endpoints according to RESTFul standards. Instead of /movies endpoints accessible by several HTTP verbs, thereâ€™s 1 endpoint called /create, another called /update, etc. The action should not be in the name of the endpoint.
Code uses old javascript features (var) instead of the newest ones (let, const)
Using callbacks
Only 2 commit messages. Cannot evaluate so well the thought process and how the project was built.
Configuration done in the same file as the server initialization.
No tests
Not using a logger
Not using Swagger to document the endpoints
Not using Docker
No command to populate the DB
